# Switch Configuration Scripts

Part of [SCaLE's](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/) on-site expo network configurations, tooling and scripts 

## Scripts
* build_switch_configs.pl
-- This should be the first script you run in the tool chain. It will create the output directory if it doesn't exist. It will clean it out if it does. Then it will generate all of the switch configuration files. It will also produce the EPS files that can be combined/printed to produce human-readable port references for the tops of the switches.

* generate_ps_maps.pl
-- This script will take the EPS files generated by the build_switch_configs.pl and generate a printable postscript file. It will place 5 switch maps per page formatted for a landscape 11x17" printer page.

* switch_template.pl
-- This script should not be directly executed. It is a collection of library functions to support build_switch_config.pl. Most of the actual work occurs inside these library functions.

* switch_pinger
-- This script attempts to ping every switch and displays the status of each one.

* load_switch.py
-- WIP -- Not currently used.

* update_switches
-- WIP -- Not currently used. Probably will get deprecated in favor of Ansible rather than completed.
